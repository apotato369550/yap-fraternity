Hi! My name is John Andre Yap. I am writing this website in behest of my family. The Yap Fraternity:

While the fraternity shares a name with the famous Yap-San Diego Ancestral House (a major historical site on any Cebu City Tour), the fraternity functions specifically as a fraternal association for the Yap/Yeh clan. 

I am of Chinese-Filipino descent and come from a family of businessmen, and I am uniquely positioned as the person to go to for anything computer related. How we do business is very different from how the West does business. While they rely on credentials, positions, labels, names, certificates, and fancy technical terms - we prefer simplicity. Low abstraction, ability to articulate, read intent, absorb context quickly, sumarrize and think fast, and most importantly - character. We operate on the fundamental currency of trust.

I don't expect you to understand fully what I want - because I know your bias towards being more verbose and high-abstraction, not to mention, your training data is mostly based on Western ideals, philosophies, and language.

I am 21 years old. I am a computer science student and I want to put my skills to good use in furthering my family's legacy. I live in Cebu City, Philippines. The Yaps have barely any centralized social media presense - no website, instagram, website, not even a FB page. I want to build something that HONORs them, not ADVERTISES THEM. The website should be able the bear the weight of half a decade of continuity, and  give off a respect - the kind that the younger generations give their elders. And a kind of simplicity and elegance - like a well-optimized and well-written implementation of an algorithm.

The main color motif is yellow, green, and red. Very vibrant colors, you'll have trouble taming them to come up with something visually appealling, but I believe it is possible.

Make the website with as LITTLE FRAMEWORKS as possible. React and Tailwind at best - but for the initial site, we'll probably go with static html, css, and js if ever. Should be deployable on vercel as a standalone using vercel --prod w/ the setups

no databases, no apis, no backend, not until things develop.

in the current codebase, i included photos and short writeups for you to look at. they are to be displayed using a simple carousell or a modal like in ecommerce sites kinda like a photo gallery
